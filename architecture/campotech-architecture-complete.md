```

### Degraded But Usable Product

The system MUST remain functional when optional modules are disabled:

| Disabled Module | Degraded Behavior | User Impact |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **WhatsApp** | Manual phone calls for notifications; email fallback for invoices | Higher manual effort; still fully functional |
| **Voice AI** | Jobs created manually only; voice messages logged but not processed | No auto-job-creation; core workflows unaffected |
| **Offline Mode** | Mobile app requires connectivity; shows "No connection" when offline | Technicians need signal; can still use web portal |
| **MP Payments** | Cash/transfer only; manual payment recording | No card payments; invoicing still works |
| **AFIP** (emergency) | Invoices saved as drafts; queued for CAE when service recovers | Delayed fiscal compliance; jobs/payments unaffected |
| **Consumer Marketplace** | Consumer app shows maintenance message; B2B unaffected | No consumer leads; existing business workflows intact |
| **Customer Portal** | Portal URLs unavailable; SMS/WhatsApp notifications only | Customers call for updates; technician app unaffected |
| **Inventory** | Manual parts tracking; materials entered on invoices | No stock alerts; pricebook still available |
| **Audit Logging** | Basic app logs only; no change tracking | Compliance audits not supported; core features work |

### Feature Flag Configuration

> **IMPORTANT:** CampoTech uses a comprehensive **Capability Map** architecture for all feature toggles and kill switches. See **[capabilities.md](./capabilities.md)** for the complete documentation and **`/core/config/capabilities.ts`** for the runtime implementation.

The Capability Map provides:
- **Centralized Control:** One file controls all inter-module toggles
- **Runtime Flexibility:** Turn off any subsystem instantly without code changes
- **Graceful Degradation:** Prevent code from calling broken dependencies
- **Observable State:** All capability checks are logged

```typescript
// Import the capability system
import { Capabilities, ensureCapability } from '@/core/config/capabilities';

// Example: Guard AFIP calls with fallback
if (!ensureCapability("external.afip", Capabilities.external.afip)) {
  return createDraftInvoice(data); // fallback when AFIP disabled
}
return AfipService.requestCAE(data); // normal flow

// Capability categories:
// - external: afip, mercadopago, whatsapp, whatsapp_voice_ai, push_notifications
// - domain: invoicing, payments, scheduling, job_assignment, offline_sync, technician_gps,
//           consumer_marketplace, customer_portal, inventory_management, audit_logging
// - services: cae_queue, whatsapp_queue, whatsapp_aggregation, payment_reconciliation,
//             abuse_detection, rate_limiting, analytics_pipeline, review_fraud_detection,
//             notification_queue
// - ui: simple_mode, advanced_mode, pricebook, reporting_dashboard, marketplace_dashboard,
//       whitelabel_portal
```

**Environment Variable Overrides:**
```bash
# Disable AFIP at runtime
CAPABILITY_EXTERNAL_AFIP=false

# Disable WhatsApp at runtime
CAPABILITY_EXTERNAL_WHATSAPP=false
```

# 2. CORE PRINCIPLES & NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

## Design Principles

### Principle 1: One-Shot Culture
- First task completion < 2 minutes
- Zero visible errors in first session
- All failures handled invisibly with fallbacks

### Principle 2: Aggressive Minimal Onboarding
- **Maximum 2 required fields:** CUIT + Company Name
- Everything else deferred to first use (just-in-time)
- No blocking wizards, ever

### Principle 3: Reliability Over Sophistication
- Every external API has a fallback
- Every background job is monitored
- Panic modes auto-activate on failure
- Silent failures are bugs

### Principle 4: Simple by Default
- Simple mode is default (never ask)
- Advanced features hidden until requested
- Maximum 3 choices per screen

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- API response time: < 200ms (p95)
- Mobile cold start: < 4s on Samsung A10
- Memory usage: < 150MB on 2GB RAM devices
- Offline sync: Queue up to 50 operations

### Reliability
- System uptime: 99.5%
- Zero duplicate invoices (enforced at DB level)
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation on external service failure

### Security
- Encryption at rest: AES-256-GCM
- Encryption in transit: TLS 1.3
- AFIP certificates encrypted with key rotation
- 10-year invoice retention (AFIP compliance)

### Scalability
- Support 10K concurrent users at launch
- Horizontal scaling for queue workers
- Database read replicas for reporting

---

## Performance & Reliability SLIs/SLOs

> **Note:** These are concrete, measurable targets that define system health. Queue workers and monitoring dashboards MUST track these metrics and alert on violations.

### Mobile App Performance (Target Devices: Samsung A10, Moto G7, Xiaomi Redmi 8)

| Metric | SLI Definition | SLO Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Cold Start | Time from app icon tap to interactive job list | < 5s (p95) | > 7s triggers investigation |
| Job List Load | Time to render 200 jobs with scroll ready | < 1.5s (p95) | > 3s |
| Photo Capture to Queue | Time from shutter to "queued for upload" | < 500ms (p95) | > 1s |
| Memory Usage | Peak RAM during normal operation | < 150MB | > 200MB crashes on 2GB devices |
| Bundle Size | Initial JS + assets download | < 5MB compressed | > 8MB |
| Offline Queue Capacity | Max operations before warning | 50 ops / 20MB | > 100 ops shows "sync required" |

### API Performance

| Metric | SLI Definition | SLO Target | Alert Threshold |
|--------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Response Time | Time from request received to response sent | < 200ms (p95) | > 500ms (p99) |
| Availability | Successful responses / Total requests | 99.5% monthly | < 99% in 1 hour |
| Error Rate | 5xx responses / Total requests | < 0.5% | > 2% in 5 minutes |
| Throughput | Requests handled per second | 500 req/s sustained | < 100 req/s |

### Queue & Background Job Performance

| Queue | SLI Definition | SLO Target | Alert Threshold |
|-------|----------------|------------|-----------------|
| **AFIP Invoice (afip:invoice)** | Time from enqueue to CAE received | < 30s (p95) | > 2 min |
| **Payment Webhook (payment:webhook)** | Time from MP callback to DB updated | < 5s (p95) | > 30s |
| **WhatsApp Outbound (whatsapp:outbound)** | Time from enqueue to delivered | < 10s (p95) | > 60s |
| **Voice Transcription (voice:transcription)** | Time from audio received to text | < 15s (p95) | > 45s |
| **Offline Sync (sync:offline)** | Time from device online to sync complete | < 30s (p95) | > 2 min |
| **All Queues** | Jobs in DLQ per hour | < 5 | > 20 triggers panic mode |

### External Service Latency Budgets

| Service | Expected Latency | Timeout | Retry Strategy |
|---------|------------------|---------|----------------|
| AFIP WSFE | 2-10s typical | 30s | 5 retries, AFIP backoff (30s, 2m, 5m, 15m, 30m) |
| Mercado Pago API | 200-500ms | 10s | 3 retries, exponential (1s, 2s, 4s) |
| WhatsApp Cloud API | 100-300ms | 15s | 3 retries, WA backoff (5s, 15s, 60s) |
| OpenAI Whisper | 3-8s (30s audio) | 60s | 2 retries, exponential |
| Supabase | 10-50ms | 5s | 3 retries, exponential |

### Offline Mode Constraints

| Constraint | Limit | Rationale |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| Max queued operations | 50 | Prevents unbounded memory growth |
| Max queued photos | 20 (10MB total) | Storage constraints on low-end devices |
| Max offline duration | 72 hours | After this, force sync on next connection |
| Sync batch size | 10 operations | Prevents timeout on slow connections |
| Conflict warning threshold | 5 conflicts | More than 5 prompts "contact support" |

### Alerting & Escalation

```
SEVERITY LEVELS:

P1 (Critical) - Page on-call immediately:
  - AFIP queue depth > 100 OR latency > 5 min
  - Payment webhook processing stopped
  - API error rate > 5%
  - Database connection failures

P2 (High) - Slack alert, respond within 1 hour:
  - Any queue DLQ > 20 items
  - Mobile cold start > 7s (p95)
  - WhatsApp delivery rate < 90%

P3 (Medium) - Slack alert, respond within 4 hours:
  - Voice AI accuracy < 65%
  - Offline sync failures > 10%
  - Memory usage approaching limits

P4 (Low) - Daily digest:
  - Performance degradation trends
  - Error rate increases within SLO
  - Capacity planning warnings
```

### Panic Mode Thresholds

| Service | Trigger Condition | Panic Behavior | Recovery |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|----------|
| AFIP | > 50% failures in 5 min OR > 100 queued | Stop new requests, queue all | Auto-recover when < 10% failures for 5 min |
| Mercado Pago | > 30% webhook failures | Fall back to polling | Auto-recover on 3 consecutive successes |
| WhatsApp | > 20% delivery failures | Fall back to SMS | Manual recovery (template issues) |
| Voice AI | > 40% confidence < 0.5 | Route to human review | Auto-recover when accuracy > 70% |

### Circuit Breaker Configuration

| Service | Failure Threshold | Open Duration | Half-Open Probes | Panic Threshold |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|-----------------|
| AFIP | 5 consecutive | 5 min | 1 every 30 sec | 15 min open → Panic |
| WhatsApp | 10 consecutive | 1 min | 1 every 15 sec | 10 min open → Panic |
| Mercado Pago | 5 consecutive | 2 min | 1 every 30 sec | 10 min open → Panic |
| OpenAI (Voice) | 3 consecutive | 30 sec | 1 every 10 sec | 5 min open → Panic |

**Circuit Breaker States:**
```
CLOSED → (failures >= threshold) → OPEN → (timeout) → HALF_OPEN → (probe success) → CLOSED
                                                    → (probe fails) → OPEN
                                                    → (open too long) → PANIC
```

# 4. DOMAIN MODEL & SYSTEM OF RECORD

## Event Ownership Matrix

| Domain | System of Record | Event Authority | Conflict Rule |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Organizations** | `organizations` table | AuthService | Server wins |
| **Users** | `users` table | UserService | Server wins |
| **Customers** | `customers` table | CustomerService | Server wins, merge on sync |
| **Jobs** | `jobs` table | JobService | Mobile completion wins (unless cancelled) |
| **Invoices** | `invoices` table | InvoiceService | AFIP authoritative for CAE |
| **Payments** | `payments` table | PaymentService | MP webhook authoritative |
| **Messages** | `whatsapp_messages` | MessageService | WA delivery status authoritative |

## Conflict Resolution Rules

```
Job Conflicts:
├── Mobile status='completed' + Server status!='cancelled' → Mobile wins
├── Server status='cancelled' → Server wins (always)
├── Both have edits to notes/photos → Merge (append)
└── Timestamp conflict → Server timestamp wins

Invoice Conflicts:
├── CAE received from AFIP → AFIP data is authoritative
├── Draft with no CAE → Server version wins
└── Payment status → MP webhook is authoritative

Customer Conflicts:
├── Same phone number → Merge non-null fields
├── Different addresses → Keep server address, log conflict
└── New customer from offline → Create if no phone match
```

## Domain Events

```typescript
type DomainEvent =
  // Jobs
  | { type: 'job.created'; payload: Job }
  | { type: 'job.status_changed'; payload: { job: Job; from: string; to: string } }

# 5.5 NAMING & STATUS CONVENTIONS

> **Single Source of Truth:** This section defines ALL naming conventions and status values. DB enums, API schemas, and mobile constants MUST be generated from these definitions.

## Naming Conventions

### Database (PostgreSQL)

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Tables | `snake_case`, plural | `customers`, `job_photos` |
| Columns | `snake_case` | `org_id`, `created_at` |
| Primary Keys | `id` (UUID) | `id UUID PRIMARY KEY` |
| Foreign Keys | `{table}_id` | `customer_id`, `job_id` |
| Timestamps | `{action}_at` | `created_at`, `updated_at`, `deleted_at` |
| Enums | `snake_case` | `job_status`, `invoice_status` |
| Indexes | `idx_{table}_{columns}` | `idx_jobs_org_status` |
| Constraints | `{table}_{type}_{columns}` | `invoices_unique_cae` |

### API (REST/JSON)

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Endpoints | `kebab-case`, plural | `/api/v1/customers`, `/api/v1/job-photos` |
| Request/Response fields | `camelCase` | `orgId`, `createdAt` |
| Query params | `camelCase` | `?customerId=123&pageSize=20` |
| Enum values | `snake_case` (match DB) | `"status": "pending_cae"` |

### Mobile (React Native/TypeScript)

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Types/Interfaces | `PascalCase` | `Customer`, `JobStatus` |
| Variables/Functions | `camelCase` | `customerId`, `fetchJobs()` |
| Constants | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` | `MAX_OFFLINE_QUEUE` |
| Enum values | `PascalCase` | `JobStatus.EnCamino` |

### Mapping Layer

```typescript
// lib/mapping.ts - Automatic conversion between DB and API

// DB → API (snake_case → camelCase)
export function toApiFormat<T>(dbRecord: Record<string, any>): T {
  return Object.entries(dbRecord).reduce((acc, [key, value]) => {
    const camelKey = key.replace(/_([a-z])/g, (_, c) => c.toUpperCase());
    acc[camelKey] = value;
    return acc;
  }, {} as T);
}

// API → DB (camelCase → snake_case)
export function toDbFormat<T>(apiPayload: Record<string, any>): T {
  return Object.entries(apiPayload).reduce((acc, [key, value]) => {
    const snakeKey = key.replace(/[A-Z]/g, c => `_${c.toLowerCase()}`);
    acc[snakeKey] = value;
    return acc;
  }, {} as T);
}
```

## Status Values (Canonical Definitions)

> **IMPORTANT:** These are the ONLY valid status values. Any addition requires updating this section, DB enum, API schema, AND mobile constants.

### Job Status

```typescript
// CANONICAL DEFINITION
export enum JobStatus {
  PENDING = 'pending',       // Created, not scheduled
  SCHEDULED = 'scheduled',   // Has technician + date/time
  EN_CAMINO = 'en_camino',   // Technician traveling
  WORKING = 'working',       // Technician on-site
  COMPLETED = 'completed',   // Work finished
  CANCELLED = 'cancelled',   // Job cancelled
}

// DB: CREATE TYPE job_status AS ENUM ('pending', 'scheduled', 'en_camino', 'working', 'completed', 'cancelled');
// API: oneOf: ["pending", "scheduled", "en_camino", "working", "completed", "cancelled"]
```

### Invoice Status

```typescript
export enum InvoiceStatus {
  DRAFT = 'draft',                 // Editable, no CAE requested
  PENDING_CAE = 'pending_cae',     // CAE request in progress
  ISSUED = 'issued',               // CAE received, not sent
  SENT = 'sent',                   // Sent to customer
  PAID = 'paid',                   // Full payment received
  PARTIAL = 'partial',             // Partial payment received
  OVERDUE = 'overdue',             // Past due date
  CANCELLED = 'cancelled',         // Cancelled (no CAE) or voided
  REFUNDED = 'refunded',           // Full refund issued
}

// DB: CREATE TYPE invoice_status AS ENUM ('draft', 'pending_cae', 'issued', 'sent', 'paid', 'partial', 'overdue', 'cancelled', 'refunded');
```

### Payment Status

```typescript
export enum PaymentStatus {
  PENDING = 'pending',             // Awaiting payment
  PROCESSING = 'processing',       // MP processing
  APPROVED = 'approved',           // Payment successful
  REJECTED = 'rejected',           // Payment failed
  CANCELLED = 'cancelled',         // Payment cancelled
  REFUNDED = 'refunded',           // Full refund processed
  PARTIAL_REFUND = 'partial_refund', // Partial refund processed
  IN_DISPUTE = 'in_dispute',       // Chargeback/dispute initiated
  CHARGEDBACK = 'chargedback',     // Chargeback resolved (customer won)
}

// DB: CREATE TYPE payment_status AS ENUM ('pending', 'processing', 'approved', 'rejected', 'cancelled', 'refunded', 'partial_refund', 'in_dispute', 'chargedback');
```

### WhatsApp Message Status

```typescript
export enum MessageStatus {
  RECEIVED = 'received',           // Inbound message received
  QUEUED = 'queued',               // In outbound queue
  SENT = 'sent',                   // Sent to WhatsApp API
  DELIVERED = 'delivered',         // Delivered to device
  READ = 'read',                   // Read by recipient
  FAILED = 'failed',               // Delivery failed
  FALLBACK_SMS = 'fallback_sms',   // Sent via SMS instead
  UNDELIVERABLE = 'undeliverable', // Permanently failed (no retry)
}

// DB: CREATE TYPE message_status AS ENUM ('received', 'queued', 'sent', 'delivered', 'read', 'failed', 'fallback_sms', 'undeliverable');
```

### Sync Status (Offline Operations)

```typescript
export enum SyncStatus {
  PENDING = 'pending',             // Waiting to sync
  SYNCING = 'syncing',             // Currently syncing
  SYNCED = 'synced',               // Successfully synced
  CONFLICT = 'conflict',           // Conflict detected
  FAILED = 'failed',               // Sync failed
}

// DB: CREATE TYPE sync_status AS ENUM ('pending', 'syncing', 'synced', 'conflict', 'failed');
```

### Voice Message Processing Status

```typescript
export enum VoiceProcessingStatus {
  PENDING = 'pending',             // Awaiting processing
  TRANSCRIBING = 'transcribing',   // Whisper processing
  EXTRACTING = 'extracting',       // GPT extraction
  COMPLETED = 'completed',         // Job created successfully
  NEEDS_REVIEW = 'needs_review',   // Low confidence, needs human review
  REVIEWED = 'reviewed',           // Human reviewed and confirmed
  FAILED = 'failed',               // Processing failed
}

// DB: CREATE TYPE voice_status_enum AS ENUM ('pending', 'transcribing', 'extracting', 'completed', 'needs_review', 'reviewed', 'failed');
```

# 7. API ARCHITECTURE

> **Implementation Note (2025-12-10):** The codebase has **two parallel API implementations**:
> - **Next.js App Router** (`/apps/web/app/api/*`) - Internal dashboard and web UI
> - **Express Public API** (`/src/api/public/v1/*`) - External integrations and mobile app
>
> Some endpoints are implemented in one or both systems. This creates code duplication that should be consolidated. See "Dual API Architecture" section below.

## Base URL Structure

```
Production:  https://api.campotech.com/v1
Staging:     https://api.staging.campotech.com/v1
Development: http://localhost:3000/api

Full endpoint example:
  https://api.campotech.com/v1/customers
  https://api.campotech.com/v1/jobs/123/status
```

**Note:** This document uses `/api/` prefix for readability. The actual deployed URLs use `/v1/` as shown above. The OpenAPI spec (`campotech-openapi-spec.yaml`) reflects the production URL structure.

## ⚠️ Dual API Architecture Warning

> **IMPORTANT:** CampoTech has TWO parallel API implementations that handle the same endpoints differently:

### 1. Next.js App Router API (Primary)
**Location:** `/apps/web/app/api/*`
- Route handlers using Next.js 14 App Router conventions
- Session-based authentication via `getServerSession()`
- Primary API for web application
- Contains most CRUD endpoints

### 2. Express Public API (Secondary)
**Location:** `/src/api/public/v1/*`
- Traditional Express.js REST API
- Bearer token authentication
- Intended for external/mobile integrations
- Contains consumer, portal, and webhook endpoints

### Implications
- **Code Duplication:** Similar endpoints exist in both locations with different implementations
- **Auth Inconsistency:** Different authentication mechanisms may cause confusion
- **Maintenance Burden:** Changes may need to be applied in two places
- **Consolidation Recommended:** Future work should unify these into a single API layer

## Implementation Status Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ | Fully implemented |
| ⚠️ | Partially implemented |
| ⏳ | Planned / Not yet implemented |
| 🔧 | Implementation differs from spec |

# 8. EXTERNAL INTEGRATIONS

## AFIP Integration

### Services Used
- **WSAA:** Authentication service (token generation)
- **WSFEv1:** Electronic invoicing (CAE requests)
- **WS_SR_PADRON:** Taxpayer validation (CUIT lookup)

### Authentication Flow (WSAA)
```
1. Generate TRA (Ticket de Requerimiento de Acceso)
   - XML with service, generation time, expiration time
   - Sign with organization's private key (PKCS#7)
2. Call LoginCms SOAP endpoint
3. Receive TA (Ticket de Acceso)
   - Contains token + sign
   - Valid for 12-24 hours
4. Cache TA, refresh before expiry
```

### Invoice Flow (WSFEv1)
```
1. Get last invoice number: FECompUltimoAutorizado
2. Build invoice request: FECAESolicitar
   - CbteTipo: 1 (A), 6 (B), 11 (C)
   - DocTipo: 80 (CUIT), 96 (DNI), 99 (Final Consumer)
   - Concept: 1 (Products), 2 (Services), 3 (Both)
3. Handle response:
   - Result 'A': Success, extract CAE + expiry
   - Result 'R': Rejected, extract error codes
4. Generate QR code (RG 4291 format)
```

### Error Handling
```
Transient (retry):
  - Connection timeout
  - Service unavailable
  - Token expired (re-authenticate)

Permanent (fail):
  - Invalid CUIT
  - Invalid punto de venta
  - Invalid invoice type
  - Certificate expired
```

### AFIP Invariance & Compliance Rules

> **CRITICAL:** Violating these rules creates tax/audit risk for customers. These are NON-NEGOTIABLE.

#### Invoice Numbering Rules

```
AFIP NUMBERING INVARIANT:
1. Invoice numbers are SEQUENTIAL per (org_id, punto_venta, cbte_tipo)
2. NO GAPS allowed in production sequences
3. Numbers are NEVER reused
4. Numbers are NEVER skipped (even on error)
5. Sequence is PER invoice type:
   - Factura A: 00001-00000001, 00001-00000002, ...
   - Factura B: 00001-00000001, 00001-00000002, ... (separate sequence)
   - Factura C: 00001-00000001, 00001-00000002, ... (separate sequence)
```

#### Sequence Reservation Strategy

```typescript
// CORRECT: Reserve number BEFORE calling AFIP
async function requestCAE(invoice: Invoice): Promise<CAEResult> {
  // 1. Get and lock next number in transaction
  const nextNumber = await db.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    const seq = await tx.afip_sequences.update({
      where: {
        org_id_punto_venta_cbte_tipo: {
          org_id: invoice.org_id,
          punto_venta: invoice.punto_venta,
          cbte_tipo: invoice.cbte_tipo
        }
      },
      data: { last_number: { increment: 1 } },
    });
    return seq.last_number;
  });

  // 2. Call AFIP with reserved number
  const result = await afip.FECAESolicitar(invoice, nextNumber);

  // 3. On success OR failure, the number is consumed
  //    (never decrement, never reuse)
  await db.invoices.update({
    where: { id: invoice.id },
    data: {
      invoice_number: nextNumber,
      cae: result.success ? result.cae : null,
      cae_expiry: result.success ? result.cae_expiry : null,
      afip_status: result.success ? 'approved' : 'rejected',
      afip_error: result.error || null,
    }
  });

  return result;
}
```

#### Immutable Fields After CAE

| Field | Mutable Before CAE | Mutable After CAE | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `invoice_number` | Yes | **NO** | AFIP sequence locked |
| `cbte_tipo` | Yes | **NO** | Invoice type is fiscal |
| `cbte_desde` / `cbte_hasta` | Yes | **NO** | Range is fiscal |
| `punto_venta` | Yes | **NO** | Billing point is fiscal |
| `customer_cuit` | Yes | **NO** | Taxpayer ID is fiscal |
| `customer_name` | Yes | **NO** | Must match CUIT holder |
| `total_amount` | Yes | **NO** | Amount is fiscal |
| `subtotal` | Yes | **NO** | Base for IVA is fiscal |
| `iva_amount` | Yes | **NO** | Tax amount is fiscal |
| `cae` | N/A | **NO** | AFIP-issued, never changes |
| `cae_expiry` | N/A | **NO** | AFIP-issued, never changes |
| `emission_date` | Yes | **NO** | Fiscal date locked |
| `qr_data` | N/A | **NO** | Based on CAE |
| `pdf_url` | N/A | Can regenerate | PDF is a representation |
| `internal_notes` | Yes | Yes | Not fiscal data |
| `metadata` | Yes | Yes | Not fiscal data |

#### Handling Draft vs CAE Request vs Rejection

```
INVOICE LIFECYCLE:

[draft] ──> User edits freely (all fields mutable)
   │
   ▼
[cae_pending] ──> Number reserved, AFIP call in progress
   │              (fields now LOCKED, no edits allowed)
   │
   ├──(success)──> [cae_issued] ──> Invoice is FINAL
   │                               (only internal_notes mutable)
   │
   └──(failure)──> [cae_rejected] ──> Number CONSUMED but no CAE
                                      (cannot edit and retry with same number)

REJECTED INVOICE HANDLING:
1. Invoice stays rejected with consumed number
2. User must create NEW invoice (new draft, new number)
3. Original rejected invoice archived for audit trail
4. NEVER: edit rejected invoice and re-submit
```

#### AFIP Error Codes & UI Behavior

| Error Code | Description | UI Behavior | System Action |
|------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| `10016` | Invalid CUIT | Show: "CUIT inválido. Verificá los datos del cliente." | Block resubmit, require customer edit |
| `10048` | Duplicate invoice | Show: "Factura ya procesada" | Check existing CAE, recover if exists |
| `10013` | Invalid punto de venta | Show: "Punto de venta no autorizado" | Contact admin (config issue) |
| `10018` | Date out of range | Show: "Fecha fuera de rango permitido" | Auto-adjust to today |
| `10017` | Total mismatch | Show: "Error de cálculo. Contacta soporte." | Log for investigation |
| `502/503` | Service unavailable | Show: "AFIP no disponible. Reintentando..." | Auto-retry with backoff |
| `Token expired` | Auth expired | (invisible to user) | Re-authenticate, retry |

#### Retention & Audit Requirements

```
LEGAL RETENTION (Argentina):
- Invoices: 10 years from emission date
- Cannot be deleted, only archived
- Must preserve: CAE, amounts, customer data, dates
- PDF regeneration allowed (from immutable data)

AUDIT TRAIL REQUIREMENTS:
- Every invoice state change logged
- CAE request/response stored
- User who created/modified tracked
- Timestamp for all operations
- Error responses preserved

STORAGE STRATEGY:
- Active invoices: Primary database (hot)
- Invoices > 2 years: Archive table (warm)
- Invoices > 5 years: Cold storage (S3 Glacier)
- All tiers: Same query interface via view
```

#### Database Enforcement

```sql
-- Prevent updates to fiscal fields after CAE issued
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION prevent_fiscal_field_mutation()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF OLD.cae IS NOT NULL THEN
    -- CAE exists, check for illegal mutations
    IF NEW.invoice_number != OLD.invoice_number OR
       NEW.cbte_tipo != OLD.cbte_tipo OR
       NEW.punto_venta != OLD.punto_venta OR
       NEW.customer_cuit != OLD.customer_cuit OR
       NEW.total_amount != OLD.total_amount OR
       NEW.subtotal != OLD.subtotal OR
       NEW.iva_amount != OLD.iva_amount OR
       NEW.emission_date != OLD.emission_date OR
       NEW.cae != OLD.cae OR
       NEW.cae_expiry != OLD.cae_expiry THEN
      RAISE EXCEPTION 'Cannot modify fiscal fields after CAE issued';
    END IF;
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER enforce_invoice_immutability
  BEFORE UPDATE ON invoices
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION prevent_fiscal_field_mutation();
```

### Homologation vs Production
```
Homologation:
  - WSAA: https://wsaahomo.afip.gov.ar/ws/services/LoginCms

```

## Mercado Pago Integration

### OAuth Flow
```
1. Redirect to MP authorization:
   https://auth.mercadopago.com/authorization?
     client_id={APP_ID}&
     response_type=code&
     redirect_uri={CALLBACK_URL}&
     platform_id=mp

  back_urls: { success, failure, pending },
  notification_url: webhook_url,
  external_reference: invoice_id,
  payment_methods: {
    installments: 12,
    default_installments: 1
  }
}
→ Returns: { id, init_point, sandbox_init_point }
```

### Webhook Events
```
payment.created    → Create pending payment record
payment.approved   → Mark invoice as paid
payment.rejected   → Log rejection reason
payment.refunded   → Update refund amount
chargeback.created → Create dispute, notify urgently
```

### Cuotas (TEA/CFT)
```
GET /v1/payment_methods/installments?amount={amount}&payment_method_id={pm_id}
→ Returns installment options with:
  - installments: number of payments
  - installment_amount: per-payment amount
  - total_amount: total with interest
  - labels: ["CFT: XX%"]
  
Calculate TEA: ((total/principal)^(12/months) - 1) * 100
```

## WhatsApp Cloud API Integration

### Setup
```
1. Create Meta Business account
2. Create WhatsApp Business App
3. Add phone number, verify
4. Submit message templates for approval
5. Configure webhook URL
```

### Message Templates (Pre-approved)
```
job_confirmation:
  "Hola {{1}}, tu servicio de {{2}} está agendado para {{3}}. Te avisamos cuando el técnico esté en camino."

tech_en_route:
  "{{1}}, tu técnico está en camino. Llegada estimada: {{2}} minutos."

job_completed:
  "{{1}}, tu servicio fue completado. Te enviamos la factura a continuación."

invoice_with_payment:
  "Factura #{{1}} por ${{2}}. Pagá con Mercado Pago: {{3}}"

# 9. QUEUE + WORKER ARCHITECTURE

## Queue Configuration

| Queue | Concurrency | Rate Limit | Max Size | Overflow | Retries | Backoff |
|-------|-------------|------------|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| afip-invoices | 2 | 10/min | 1000 | priority_only | 10 | exponential (1m base) |
| whatsapp-outbound | 10 | 50/min | 5000 | drop_oldest | 3 | exponential (30s base) |
| photo-upload | 5 | - | 10000 | reject | 5 | exponential (1m base) |
| voice-processing | 3 | - | 500 | reject | 3 | exponential (30s base) |
| payment-sync | 3 | - | 500 | reject | 5 | exponential (1m base) |

## Retry Logic

```typescript
retryStrategy = {
  maxAttempts: config.retries,
  backoff: {
    type: 'exponential',
    delay: config.baseDelay,
    maxDelay: 300000 // 5 minutes max
  },
  retryOn: (error) => isTransientError(error)
}

isTransientError(error):
  - Connection timeout
  - Service unavailable (5xx)
  - Rate limited (429)
  - NOT: validation errors, auth errors, permanent failures
```

## Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

```
DLQ Entry:
  - Original job data
  - Error message + stack
  - Attempt count
  - Timestamps (created, last_attempt)
  - Queue name

DLQ Handling:
  1. Alert if DLQ size > 10 items
  2. Alert if item age > 1 hour
  3. Manual review required
  4. Options: retry, discard, fix data + retry
```

## Backpressure Strategies

```typescript
overflowStrategies = {
  reject: () => {
    // Return error, alert
    throw new QueueOverflowError();
  },
  drop_oldest: () => {
    // Remove oldest low-priority items
    await queue.clean(10, 'delayed', { priority: 'low' });
  },
  priority_only: (job) => {
    // Only accept priority >= 8
    if (job.priority < 8) throw new LowPriorityRejectedError();
  }
}
```

## Priority Processing

```
Priority levels: 1 (low) to 10 (high)

Processing ratio: [1, 2, 4]
  - Process 4 high-priority jobs
  - Then 2 medium-priority jobs
  - Then 1 low-priority job

Default priorities:
  - AFIP retry after failure: 8
  - New invoice: 5
  - WhatsApp notification: 5
  - Photo upload: 3
```

## Worker Scaling

```
Scaling rules:
  - Queue depth > 100: scale up workers
  - Queue depth < 10 for 5min: scale down
  - Error rate > 10%: pause scaling, alert
  - Min workers: 1 per queue
  - Max workers: 5 per queue

| Passwords | bcrypt (cost 12) | TLS 1.3 | N/A |
| Session Tokens | Short-lived JWT | TLS 1.3 | Per session |
| Invoices (PDF) | Storage encryption | TLS 1.3 | Yearly |
| Audit Logs | Storage encryption | TLS 1.3 | Immutable |

## Secrets & Key Management

> **CRITICAL:** This section defines where sensitive credentials are stored, rotation policies, and environment separation requirements.

### Secret Categories

| Secret Type | Storage Location | Access Pattern | Rotation |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| AFIP Certificates (.pfx) | AWS Secrets Manager | Worker on startup | Manual (2yr cert expiry) |
| AFIP Private Key | AWS KMS (CMK) | Never leaves KMS | Never (bound to cert) |
| Mercado Pago Access Token | AWS Secrets Manager | API on request | Auto (6hr via refresh) |
| Mercado Pago Refresh Token | AWS Secrets Manager (encrypted) | Auth service | On access token refresh |
| WhatsApp Access Token | AWS Secrets Manager | Worker on request | Manual (Meta doesn't expire) |
| OpenAI API Key | AWS Secrets Manager | Voice worker | Manual (quarterly review) |
| Database URL | Environment variable | App on startup | On credential rotation |
| Redis URL | Environment variable | App on startup | On credential rotation |
| JWT Signing Key | AWS Secrets Manager | Auth service | Yearly |
| Encryption Keys | AWS KMS (CMK) | Via envelope encryption | Yearly (auto) |

### Storage Architecture

```
SECRET STORAGE HIERARCHY
========================

AWS Secrets Manager (for rotatable secrets):
├── campotech/production/afip/{org_id}/certificate
├── campotech/production/afip/{org_id}/private_key_ref (KMS ARN)
├── campotech/production/mp/{org_id}/access_token
├── campotech/production/mp/{org_id}/refresh_token
├── campotech/production/whatsapp/access_token
├── campotech/production/openai/api_key
└── campotech/production/jwt/signing_key

AWS KMS (for encryption keys - never leave AWS):
├── campotech-production-master-key (CMK)
├── campotech-production-afip-key (for AFIP private keys)
├── campotech-production-pii-key (for customer PII)
└── campotech-production-tokens-key (for stored tokens)

Environment Variables (injected at deploy):
├── DATABASE_URL (Supabase connection string)
├── REDIS_URL (Upstash connection string)
├── AWS_REGION
├── AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID (for Secrets Manager access)
└── AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (for Secrets Manager access)
```

### Rotation Policies

```
AUTOMATIC ROTATION
──────────────────
Mercado Pago Access Token:
  - Trigger: On 401 response OR proactively at 5hr mark
  - Action: Use refresh_token to get new access_token
  - Fallback: If refresh fails, alert + require re-authorization

JWT Signing Key:
  - Trigger: Annual (January 1st)
  - Action: Generate new key, keep old for 30 days (validation)
  - Rollout: New tokens use new key, old tokens still valid

Encryption Keys (KMS):
  - Trigger: Annual (automatic via KMS policy)
  - Action: KMS rotates, old versions kept for decryption
  - Re-encryption: Background job re-encrypts active data

MANUAL ROTATION
───────────────
AFIP Certificate:
  - Trigger: 30 days before expiry (alert)
  - Action: Owner generates new cert in AFIP portal, uploads
  - Validation: Test CAE request before switching

WhatsApp Token:
  - Trigger: Meta policy change or security incident
  - Action: Generate new token in Meta Business, update secret

OpenAI API Key:
  - Trigger: Quarterly review or security incident
  - Action: Generate new key, update secret, delete old

Database/Redis URLs:
  - Trigger: Security incident or credential exposure
  - Action: Rotate credentials in provider, update env vars, redeploy
```

### Environment Separation

```
STRICT ENVIRONMENT ISOLATION
════════════════════════════

Production:
  AWS Account: campotech-prod (123456789012)
  Secrets Manager: campotech/production/*
  KMS Keys: arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:123456789012:key/prod-*
  Database: Supabase project: campotech-prod
  Redis: Upstash cluster: campotech-prod
  Domain: app.campotech.com

Staging:
  AWS Account: campotech-staging (234567890123) [SEPARATE ACCOUNT]
  Secrets Manager: campotech/staging/*
  KMS Keys: arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:234567890123:key/staging-*
  Database: Supabase project: campotech-staging
  Redis: Upstash cluster: campotech-staging
  Domain: staging.campotech.com

Development (Local):
  Secrets: .env.local (gitignored, never committed)
  Database: Local Docker PostgreSQL
  Redis: Local Docker Redis
  AFIP: Homologation credentials only
  MP: Sandbox mode only

NEVER:
  ✗ Share credentials between environments
  ✗ Use production database in staging
  ✗ Use production AFIP cert in testing
  ✗ Commit .env files to git
  ✗ Log secrets (redaction enforced)
```

### Secret Access Patterns

```typescript
// lib/secrets/manager.ts

import { SecretsManager } from '@aws-sdk/client-secrets-manager';
import { KMS } from '@aws-sdk/client-kms';

class SecretManager {
  private cache: Map<string, { value: string; expiry: number }> = new Map();
  private readonly CACHE_TTL = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes

  // Get secret with caching
  async getSecret(name: string): Promise<string> {
    const cached = this.cache.get(name);
    if (cached && cached.expiry > Date.now()) {
      return cached.value;
    }

    const secret = await this.fetchFromSecretsManager(name);
    this.cache.set(name, {
      value: secret,
      expiry: Date.now() + this.CACHE_TTL
    });

    return secret;
  }

  // Get AFIP cert for specific org
  async getAfipCertificate(orgId: string): Promise<AfipCredentials> {
    const certPath = `campotech/${process.env.ENV}/afip/${orgId}/certificate`;
    const cert = await this.getSecret(certPath);

    // Private key stays in KMS, return reference
    return {
      certificate: Buffer.from(cert, 'base64'),
      privateKeyArn: `${certPath}/private_key`,
    };
  }

  // Sign with AFIP key (never leaves KMS)
  async signWithAfipKey(orgId: string, data: Buffer): Promise<Buffer> {
    const keyArn = await this.getSecret(
      `campotech/${process.env.ENV}/afip/${orgId}/private_key_ref`
    );

    const kms = new KMS({});
    const result = await kms.sign({
      KeyId: keyArn,
      Message: data,
      SigningAlgorithm: 'RSASSA_PKCS1_V1_5_SHA_256',
    });

    return Buffer.from(result.Signature!);
  }
}
```

### RLS Policy Examples

```sql
-- Row Level Security for multi-tenant isolation

-- Organizations: Users can only see their org
ALTER TABLE organizations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY org_isolation ON organizations
  FOR ALL
  USING (id = current_setting('app.current_org_id')::uuid);

-- Customers: Isolated by org
ALTER TABLE customers ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY customer_org_isolation ON customers
  FOR ALL
  USING (org_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id')::uuid);

-- Jobs: Isolated by org, technicians see assigned jobs
ALTER TABLE jobs ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY job_org_isolation ON jobs
  FOR ALL
  USING (org_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id')::uuid);

CREATE POLICY job_technician_view ON jobs
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    org_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id')::uuid
    AND (
      current_setting('app.current_user_role') IN ('owner', 'admin', 'dispatcher')
      OR technician_id = current_setting('app.current_user_id')::uuid
    )
  );

-- Invoices: Only org members with invoice permission
ALTER TABLE invoices ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY invoice_org_isolation ON invoices
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    org_id = current_setting('app.current_org_id')::uuid
    AND current_setting('app.current_user_role') IN ('owner', 'admin', 'dispatcher')
  );

-- Set context on each request (middleware)
-- SELECT set_config('app.current_org_id', $1, true);
-- SELECT set_config('app.current_user_id', $2, true);
-- SELECT set_config('app.current_user_role', $3, true);
```

### Secret Audit Requirements

```
AUDIT LOGGING FOR SECRETS
═════════════════════════

All secret access logged to CloudTrail:
  - Who accessed (IAM principal)
  - What secret (ARN)
  - When (timestamp)
  - From where (source IP)

Alert triggers:
  - Any access from unexpected IP
  - Access outside business hours (first time)
  - Bulk secret retrieval (>10 in 1 minute)
  - Failed access attempts

Retention:
  - CloudTrail logs: 1 year
  - Secrets Manager audit: 1 year
  - KMS audit: 1 year
```

## Key Hierarchy

```
Key hierarchy:
  Master Key (AWS KMS)
    └── afip_credentials_key
    └── mp_tokens_key
    └── customer_pii_key
    └── general_encryption_key

Key versioning:
  - Each key has version ID
  - Old versions kept for decryption
  - Re-encryption scheduled during rotation
```

## Encrypted Data Format

```typescript
EncryptedData = {
  ciphertext: string   // Base64-encoded encrypted data
  iv: string           // Base64-encoded initialization vector
  authTag: string      // Base64-encoded GCM auth tag
  keyId: string        // Key version used
  algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm'
}
```

## Log Redaction

```
Sensitive patterns (auto-redacted):
  - CUIT: /\b\d{2}-\d{8}-\d{1}\b/g → 'CUIT:[REDACTED]'
  - Phone: /\b\d{10,11}\b/g → 'PHONE:[REDACTED]'
  - CBU: /\b\d{22}\b/g → 'CBU:[REDACTED]'
  - Bearer tokens: /Bearer\s+[A-Za-z0-9\-_]+/gi → 'Bearer [REDACTED]'
  - API keys: /api[_-]?key[=:]\s*["']?[A-Za-z0-9\-_]+/gi → 'api_key:[REDACTED]'

Always-redact fields:
  - password, secret, token, api_key, certificate
  - cuit, cuil, dni, cbu, card_number
```

## Abuse Detection

```
Abuse patterns checked:
  1. message_flood: >20 messages/minute from sender → rate_limit
  2. spam_content: spam score >0.8 → flag_for_review
  3. url_spam: >2 URLs in message → block
  4. new_number_flood: new sender + 5 msgs in 5min → block
  5. duplicate_messages: >3 identical messages → rate_limit
  6. off_hours_flood: 2-6am + high volume → flag_for_review
  7. known_bad_actor: on blacklist → block

Actions:
  - allow: normal processing
  - rate_limit: reduce to 5/5min
  - flag_for_review: add to review queue
  - block: add to temporary blacklist (24h)
```

## Rate Limiting

```
Per-organization limits:
  - API requests: 100/min
  - WhatsApp messages: 50/min
  - Voice messages: 50/hour
  - Job creations: 200/day

Per-sender limits (within org):
  - Messages: 10/min
  - Voice: 5/hour

Implementation: Sliding window (Redis sorted sets)
```

## Session Management

```
Session configuration:
  - Type: JWT (short-lived) + refresh token
  - Access token TTL: 15 minutes
  - Refresh token TTL: 7 days
  - Refresh rotation: Yes (new refresh on use)
  - Device tracking: Yes (user_agent, IP)
  - Concurrent sessions: Unlimited (mobile + web)

Session invalidation:
  - Logout: Revoke current session
  - Password change: Revoke all sessions
  - Suspicious activity: Revoke all + notify
```

# 11. OFFLINE MODE ARCHITECTURE

## Local Database (WatermelonDB)

```
Tables synced to mobile:
  - jobs (assigned to current user, last 30 days)
  - customers (associated with synced jobs)
  - price_book (full)
  - user (current user profile)

Tables NOT synced:
  - invoices (web-only creation)
  - payments
  - messages
  - audit_logs
```

## Sync Strategy

```
Sync direction: Bidirectional
Sync frequency: 
  - On app launch
  - On network reconnect
  - Every 5 minutes (when online)
  - Manual pull-to-refresh

Conflict resolution:
  - Server timestamp wins for most fields
  - Mobile completion data wins for job completion
  - Photos/signatures always merged (append)
```

## Offline Queue

```typescript
SyncQueue entry = {
  id: string
  action_type: 'job_update' | 'job_complete' | 'photo_upload' | 'signature_upload'
  entity_type: 'job' | 'photo' | 'signature'
  entity_id: string
  payload: JSON
  status: 'pending' | 'syncing' | 'synced' | 'conflict' | 'failed'
  created_at: timestamp
  retry_count: number
}

Max queue size: 50 operations
Retry on failure: 3 times with exponential backoff
```

## Offline-Capable Actions

```
✅ Fully offline:
  - View assigned jobs
  - View customer details
  - Update job status (en_camino, working)
  - Complete job (photos, signature, notes)
  - View price book

⚠️ Queued for sync:
  - Photo uploads
  - Signature uploads
  - Job completion data

❌ Online required:
  - Create new job
  - Create invoice
  - Send WhatsApp
  - Process payment
```

## Photo Handling (Offline)

```
Photo specifications:
  - Max resolution: 1200x1200
  - Compression: 70% JPEG
  - Max file size: 500KB
  - Thumbnail: 200x200 @ 60%

Local storage:
  - Location: App documents directory
  - Max cache: 200MB
  - Cleanup: Delete uploaded photos when cache > 150MB

Upload queue:
  - Priority: Low (priority 3)
  - Retry: 5 times
  - Batch: Upload max 3 concurrent
```

## Conflict Resolution Flow

```
On sync:
1. Fetch server version of entity
2. Compare timestamps:
   - If server.updated_at > local.updated_at:
     - Check for local uncommitted changes
     - If no local changes: Accept server version
     - If local changes: Apply conflict rules
3. Conflict rules:
   - Job status: Mobile 'completed' wins (unless server 'cancelled')
   - Photos: Merge (union of both sets)
   - Notes: Append with separator
   - Address: Server wins
4. If conflict cannot be auto-resolved:
   - Mark as 'conflict'
   - Show in app for manual resolution
```

## Detailed Conflict Resolution Scenarios

> **CRITICAL:** Poor conflict handling causes lost data and broken trust. These scenarios define EXACT behavior.

### Field-Level Resolution Rules

| Field | Conflict Strategy | Rationale |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| **status** | Special rules (see below) | Status transitions are business logic |
| **scheduled_date/time** | Server wins | Dispatcher controls schedule |
| **technician_id** | Server wins | Dispatcher controls assignment |
| **customer address** | Server wins | Customer may have corrected |
| **notes** | Append (offline + server) | Both may have added notes |
| **internal_notes** | Append (offline + server) | Both may have added |
| **photos** | Merge (union) | Never lose photos |
| **signature** | Mobile wins | Only tech can capture |
| **completion_data** | Mobile wins | Only tech knows what happened |
| **customer_name** | Server wins | Admin corrections |
| **customer_phone** | Server wins | Admin corrections |

### Status Conflict Resolution Matrix

```
When mobile has status X and server has status Y:

            SERVER STATUS
            pending | scheduled | en_camino | working | completed | cancelled
MOBILE   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
pending  │ no-op   | server   | server    | server  | server    | server
scheduled│ mobile  | no-op    | mobile    | mobile  | server    | server
en_camino│ mobile  | mobile   | no-op     | mobile  | server    | server
working  │ mobile  | mobile   | mobile    | no-op   | server    | server
completed│ mobile  | mobile   | mobile    | mobile  | no-op     | CONFLICT
cancelled│ server  | server   | server    | server  | CONFLICT  | no-op

SPECIAL RULES:
1. completed vs cancelled → Show conflict UI, user must choose
2. Mobile 'completed' always wins UNLESS server is 'cancelled'
3. Cancelled by server = dispatcher override, must respect
```

### Scenario 1: Two Technicians Edit Same Job Offline

```
SCENARIO:
- Tech A and Tech B both assigned to job (handoff scenario)
- Tech A goes offline at 10:00, marks job 'en_camino' at 10:05
- Tech B goes offline at 10:00, marks job 'working' at 10:10
- Both come online at 10:30

RESOLUTION:
1. Server receives Tech A's sync first (10:30:01)
   - Job status: pending → en_camino (accepted)
   - Server version: en_camino, updated_at: 10:30:01

2. Server receives Tech B's sync second (10:30:02)
   - Tech B's local version was based on 'pending'
   - Server is now 'en_camino'
   - Mobile status 'working' > 'en_camino' in progression
   - Result: Accept 'working' (mobile wins, forward progress)

3. Final state: working
```

### Scenario 2: Dispatcher Cancels While Tech Working Offline

```
SCENARIO:
- Dispatcher cancels job at 10:00 (customer called to cancel)
- Tech is offline since 9:30, marked 'working' at 9:45
- Tech completes job at 10:15 with photos/signature
- Tech comes online at 10:30

RESOLUTION:
1. Server has: status=cancelled, updated_at=10:00

2. Mobile has: status=completed, completion_data={...}
   - Photos: 3
   - Signature: captured
   - Notes: "Replaced faucet, tested ok"
   - Local updated_at: 10:15

3. CONFLICT DETECTED: completed vs cancelled
   - Cannot auto-resolve (work done but job cancelled)
   - Mark sync_status='conflict'
   - Show conflict UI to technician

4. CONFLICT UI:
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ ⚠️ Conflict Detected                            │
   ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │ This job was cancelled by dispatch at 10:00    │
   │ while you were offline.                        │
   │                                                 │
   │ Your completion data:                          │
   │ • 3 photos captured                            │
   │ • Signature captured                           │
   │ • Notes: "Replaced faucet, tested ok"          │
   │                                                 │
   │ What do you want to do?                        │
   │                                                 │
   │ [Keep My Completion]  [Accept Cancellation]    │
   │                                                 │
   │ Note: If you keep completion, dispatch will    │
   │ be notified to review.                         │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

5. If "Keep My Completion":
   - Update server: status=completed, keep all data
   - Send notification to dispatcher: "Tech completed cancelled job"
   - Invoice may still be created (manual review)

6. If "Accept Cancellation":
   - Discard completion_data (photos kept as orphans)
   - Accept server status: cancelled
   - Show confirmation: "Completion data discarded"
```

### Scenario 3: Notes Added by Both Sides

```
SCENARIO:
- Dispatcher adds note at 10:00: "Customer requests morning appointment"
- Tech offline, adds note at 10:15: "Arrived, customer not home"
- Tech syncs at 10:30

RESOLUTION:
1. Server notes: "Customer requests morning appointment"
2. Mobile notes: "Arrived, customer not home"

3. Strategy: APPEND (never lose information)
   Result:
   "Customer requests morning appointment
    ---
    [Offline sync - Tech at 10:15]
    Arrived, customer not home"

4. No conflict UI needed (auto-merged)
```

### Scenario 4: Address Changed While Offline

```
SCENARIO:
- Customer calls to correct address at 10:00
- Dispatcher updates: "Av. Corrientes 1234" → "Av. Corrientes 1234, Piso 3"
- Tech offline since 9:30, still has old address
- Tech syncs at 10:30

RESOLUTION:
1. Server address: "Av. Corrientes 1234, Piso 3" (updated 10:00)
2. Mobile address: "Av. Corrientes 1234" (stale)

3. Strategy: SERVER WINS (dispatcher has authoritative info)
   - Update mobile address to match server
   - Show toast: "Address updated: Piso 3 added"

4. No conflict UI needed (silent update with notification)
```

### Scenario 5: Photos Captured by Multiple Techs

```
SCENARIO:
- Tech A captures 2 photos offline
- Tech B (reassigned) captures 3 photos offline
- Both sync around same time

RESOLUTION:
1. Strategy: MERGE (union of all photos)
   - Server receives Tech A's 2 photos
   - Server receives Tech B's 3 photos
   - Final: 5 photos attached to job

2. No conflicts possible (photos are append-only)
3. Deduplication: By photo hash (SHA-256 of content)
```

### Sync Algorithm Implementation

```typescript
// lib/sync/conflict-resolver.ts

interface SyncResult {
  accepted: 'server' | 'mobile' | 'merged';
  conflicts: ConflictField[];
  requiresUI: boolean;
}

async function resolveJobConflict(
  serverJob: Job,
  mobileJob: Job,
  pendingOps: SyncOperation[]
): Promise<SyncResult> {
  const conflicts: ConflictField[] = [];
  const merged: Partial<Job> = {};

  // 1. Status resolution (most complex)
  const statusResult = resolveStatus(serverJob.status, mobileJob.status);
  if (statusResult.conflict) {
    conflicts.push({
      field: 'status',
      serverValue: serverJob.status,
      mobileValue: mobileJob.status,
      requiresUserChoice: true,
    });
  } else {
    merged.status = statusResult.winner;
  }

  // 2. Server-wins fields
  const serverWinsFields = ['scheduled_date', 'scheduled_time', 'technician_id',
                           'address', 'customer_name', 'customer_phone'];
  for (const field of serverWinsFields) {
    if (serverJob[field] !== mobileJob[field]) {
      merged[field] = serverJob[field];
    }
  }

  // 3. Mobile-wins fields
  const mobileWinsFields = ['signature', 'completion_data'];
  for (const field of mobileWinsFields) {
    if (mobileJob[field] && !serverJob[field]) {
      merged[field] = mobileJob[field];
    }
  }

  // 4. Append fields
  if (serverJob.notes !== mobileJob.notes) {
    merged.notes = mergeNotes(serverJob.notes, mobileJob.notes);
  }

  // 5. Merge photos (union)
  merged.photos = [...new Set([
    ...serverJob.photos || [],
    ...mobileJob.photos || [],
  ])];

  return {
    accepted: conflicts.length > 0 ? 'pending' : 'merged',
    conflicts,
    requiresUI: conflicts.some(c => c.requiresUserChoice),
    mergedData: merged,
  };
}

function resolveStatus(serverStatus: string, mobileStatus: string): {
  winner: string;
  conflict: boolean;
} {
  const progression = ['pending', 'scheduled', 'en_camino', 'working', 'completed'];

  // Special case: cancelled vs completed
  if (serverStatus === 'cancelled' && mobileStatus === 'completed') {
    return { winner: null, conflict: true };
  }
  if (mobileStatus === 'cancelled' && serverStatus === 'completed') {
    return { winner: null, conflict: true };
  }

  // Cancelled always wins over non-completed
  if (serverStatus === 'cancelled') {
    return { winner: 'cancelled', conflict: false };
  }

  // Forward progress: higher status wins
  const serverIdx = progression.indexOf(serverStatus);
  const mobileIdx = progression.indexOf(mobileStatus);

  return {
    winner: mobileIdx > serverIdx ? mobileStatus : serverStatus,
    conflict: false,
  };
}
```

### Append-Only Data (No Conflicts Possible)

These entities are NEVER updated, only created:

| Entity | Strategy | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Photos | Append only | New photos added, never deleted/edited |
| Signatures | Write once | Only one signature per job completion |
| Status history | Append only | Every transition logged, never modified |
| Audit logs | Append only | Immutable by design |
| Sync queue entries | Append only | Processed and archived, never edited |

# 15. FALLBACK SYSTEMS

## AFIP Fallback

```
Normal mode:
  Invoice → Request CAE → Store → Send

Panic mode (AFIP unavailable):
  Invoice → Save as Draft → Queue for retry → User sees "Factura guardada ✓"
  
Recovery:
  Background job processes draft queue
  On CAE success: Update invoice, generate PDF, notify user
  
User experience:
  - Never sees AFIP errors
  - Invoice appears created (draft)
  - Email/WhatsApp sent when CAE ready (async)
```

## WhatsApp Fallback

```
Normal mode:
  Message → WhatsApp API → Delivered

Fallback cascade:
  1. WhatsApp fails → Retry 3x with backoff
  2. Still failing → Check if critical message
  3. If critical → Send via SMS
  4. If not critical → Queue for later

Critical messages (always SMS fallback):
  - job_confirmation
  - tech_en_route
  - payment_received
  - invoice_sent

Non-critical (no SMS fallback):
  - promotional
  - follow-up surveys
```

## Mercado Pago Fallback

```
Normal mode:
  Invoice → Create MP preference → Send payment link

Fallback (MP unavailable):
  1. Show cash payment option
  2. Show bank transfer option (with org CBU)
  3. Manual payment recording

Manual payment flow:
  1. Admin marks invoice as "paid manually"
  2. Selects payment method (cash/transfer)
  3. Enters reference (receipt number/transfer ID)
  4. Invoice updated to paid
```

## Voice AI Fallback

```
Normal mode:
  Voice → Transcribe → Extract → Create job

Fallback cascade:
  1. Whisper fails → Retry 2x
  2. Still failing → Queue for later + notify
  3. Extraction fails → Human review queue
  4. Low confidence → Human review queue

Human review queue:
  - Shows audio player
  - Shows transcription (if available)
  - Shows AI extraction (if available)
  - Dispatcher corrects/completes
  - Correction feeds training data
```

## Voice AI Guardrails & Confidence Handling

> **CRITICAL:** Voice AI that "feels magic" when working and "feels scammy" when failing will destroy trust. These guardrails ensure safe, predictable behavior.

### Confidence Thresholds & Actions

| Confidence Range | Action | User Experience |
|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| **≥ 0.85** (High) | Auto-create job | Job created, WhatsApp confirms: "Trabajo creado: [summary]" |
| **0.70 - 0.84** (Medium-High) | Auto-create + flag | Job created, marked for review, notification to dispatcher |
| **0.50 - 0.69** (Medium) | Create draft, require confirmation | WhatsApp: "Entendí: [summary]. ¿Está bien? Responde SI o NO" |
| **0.30 - 0.49** (Low) | Human review queue | WhatsApp: "Recibimos tu mensaje de voz. Un operador lo revisará." |
| **< 0.30** (Very Low) | Log only, no action | WhatsApp: "No pudimos entender el mensaje. ¿Podés enviarlo de nuevo o llamar?" |

### Per-Field Confidence Scores

```typescript
interface ExtractionResult {
  overallConfidence: number;     // Combined score

  fields: {
    customerName: {
      value: string | null;
      confidence: number;        // 0-1
      source: 'explicit' | 'inferred' | 'matched';  // How we got it
    };
    customerPhone: {
      value: string | null;
      confidence: number;
    };
    address: {
      value: string | null;
      confidence: number;
      normalized: string | null;  // Google Maps normalized
    };
    serviceType: {
      value: string | null;
      confidence: number;
      matchedCategory: string | null;  // Matched to price book
    };
    preferredDate: {
      value: string | null;       // ISO date
      confidence: number;
      wasRelative: boolean;       // "mañana" vs "15 de enero"
    };
    preferredTime: {
      value: string | null;       // "morning" | "afternoon" | "HH:mm"
      confidence: number;
    };
    problemDescription: {
      value: string | null;
      confidence: number;
    };
    urgency: {
      value: 'normal' | 'urgent' | 'emergency';
      confidence: number;
    };
  };

  missingRequiredFields: string[];  // Fields we need but don't have
  ambiguities: string[];            // Things that need clarification
}
```

### Minimum Required Fields for Job Creation

```
REQUIRED (must have ≥0.6 confidence each):
├── customerPhone OR customerName (to identify)
├── address OR "same as before" indicator
└── serviceType OR problemDescription

OPTIONAL (nice to have):
├── preferredDate (default: "lo antes posible")
├── preferredTime (default: "cualquier hora")
└── urgency (default: normal)

BLOCKING ISSUES (prevent auto-creation):
├── No way to contact customer (no phone, unknown customer)
├── No address and no previous address on file
└── Transcription confidence < 0.4 (audio quality issue)
```

### Confirmation Flow (Medium Confidence)

```
SCENARIO: Customer sends voice message, confidence is 0.65

1. AI extracts:
   - Customer: "García" (confidence: 0.7)
   - Address: "Corrientes 1234" (confidence: 0.6)
   - Problem: "pérdida de agua" (confidence: 0.8)
   - Date: "mañana" (confidence: 0.5)

2. Overall confidence: 0.65 → REQUIRES CONFIRMATION

3. System sends WhatsApp template:
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ 📝 Confirmá tu pedido:                          │
   │                                                  │
   │ Cliente: García                                  │
   │ Dirección: Corrientes 1234                       │
   │ Problema: Pérdida de agua                        │
   │ Fecha: Mañana (15 ene)                          │
   │                                                  │
   │ ¿Está todo bien?                                │
   │ Responde SI para confirmar                      │
   │ Responde NO para corregir                       │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

4. Customer response handling:
   - "SI" / "Si" / "sí" / "Sí" / "👍" → Create job
   - "NO" / "No" / "no" → Route to human review
   - No response in 30 min → Send reminder
   - No response in 2 hours → Move to human review
   - Other text → Try to parse as correction
```

### V1 Limitations & Structured Prompts

```
V1 LIMITATIONS (clearly documented for users):

What works well:
✓ Clear, slow speech
✓ Standard Argentine Spanish
✓ Common service types (plomería, gas, electricidad)
✓ Simple addresses (calle + número)
✓ Explicit dates ("el lunes", "mañana", "15 de enero")

What may struggle:
△ Heavy accents or dialects
△ Fast/mumbled speech
△ Background noise (street, construction)
△ Complex addresses (intersecciones, edificios sin número)
△ Vague timing ("cuando puedas", "esta semana")

What doesn't work:
✗ Non-Spanish languages
✗ Multiple jobs in one message
✗ Cancellations or modifications (use text)
✗ Payment questions
✗ Technical questions about services

RECOMMENDED PROMPT FOR CUSTOMERS (shown in WhatsApp):
"Para crear un trabajo nuevo, enviá un audio diciendo:
- Tu nombre y dirección
- Qué problema tenés
- Cuándo te gustaría que vayamos

Ejemplo: 'Soy Juan García de Corrientes 1234, tengo una pérdida
en el baño, si puede ser mañana a la mañana'"
```

### Language & Dialect Handling

```
SUPPORTED:
- Spanish (Argentina) - primary
- Lunfardo common terms (recognized but normalized)
- Common misspellings/pronunciation

DIALECT NORMALIZATION:
- "laburo" → "trabajo"
- "plomo" → "plomero"
- "cañería" = "caño" = "tubo" → normalized to service category
- "aire" (short for "aire acondicionado") → HVAC category

CONFIDENCE PENALTIES:
- Heavy Lunfardo: -0.1 to confidence
- Mixed language: -0.2 to confidence
- Very fast speech (>200 wpm): -0.15 to confidence
- Lots of filler words ("ehh", "este"): -0.05 to confidence

WHISPER CONFIGURATION:
{
  language: 'es',
  task: 'transcribe',
  prompt: 'El siguiente audio es un mensaje de un cliente solicitando
           un servicio de plomería, gas, o electricidad en Argentina.',
  temperature: 0,  // Deterministic
}
```

### Human Review Queue UI

```
/admin/voice-review (Voice Review Queue)

ACTIONS:
- Create Job: Use AI extraction as-is
- Edit & Create: Open form with pre-filled values, allow correction
- Can't Understand: Mark as unprocessable, send "please resend" to customer
- Discard: Mark as spam/irrelevant, no customer notification

METRICS TRACKED:
- Time to review (target: <5 min)
- Correction rate (how often AI was wrong)
- Field-level accuracy (which fields need improvement)
```

### Voice AI Monitoring & Improvement

```
DAILY METRICS:
├── Total voice messages processed
├── Auto-created jobs (high confidence)

├── Human review queue additions
├── Failed/unprocessable
└── Average confidence score

WEEKLY REVIEW:
├── Listen to 10% sample of low-confidence messages
├── Identify common failure patterns
├── Update extraction prompts if needed
└── Add new training examples

IMPROVEMENT TRIGGERS:
- Accuracy drops below 65%: Alert, investigate
- Same customer fails 3x: Flag for manual follow-up
- New service type mentioned often: Add to extraction
- Common address format not recognized: Update parser
```

# 17. DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE

## Environments

```
Development:
  - Local Docker Compose
  - Supabase local
  - MP sandbox
  - WA test phone

Staging:
  - Vercel preview
  - Supabase staging project
  - MP sandbox
  - WA test phone
  - AFIP homologation

Production:
  - Vercel (web)
  - Railway/Render (workers)
  - Supabase production
  - MP production
  - WA production
  - AFIP production
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

```
On PR:
  1. Lint + type check
  2. Unit tests
  3. Build check
  4. Preview deploy (Vercel)

On merge to main:
  1. All PR checks
  2. Integration tests
  3. Deploy to staging
  4. Smoke tests on staging
  5. Manual approval gate
  6. Deploy to production
  7. Health check
  8. Rollback if health fails
```

## Blue-Green Deployment

```
Strategy:
  1. Deploy new version to "green" (inactive)
  2. Run health checks on green
  3. Gradually shift traffic (10% → 50% → 100%)
  4. If errors spike, rollback to "blue"
  5. Blue becomes green for next deploy

Worker deployment:
  1. Deploy new workers
  2. Drain old workers (finish current jobs)
  3. Terminate old workers
```

## Feature Flags & Capability Map

> **See [capabilities.md](./capabilities.md)** for the complete kill-switch architecture documentation.

CampoTech uses a **Capability Map** (`/core/config/capabilities.ts`) as the single source of truth for all feature toggles:

```
Capability Categories:
  - external: afip, mercadopago, whatsapp, whatsapp_voice_ai, push_notifications
  - domain: invoicing, payments, scheduling, job_assignment, offline_sync, technician_gps,
            consumer_marketplace, customer_portal, inventory_management, audit_logging
  - services: cae_queue, whatsapp_queue, whatsapp_aggregation, payment_reconciliation,
              abuse_detection, rate_limiting, analytics_pipeline, review_fraud_detection,
              notification_queue
  - ui: simple_mode, advanced_mode, pricebook, reporting_dashboard, marketplace_dashboard,
        whitelabel_portal

Runtime Control:
  - Environment variables: CAPABILITY_EXTERNAL_AFIP=false
  - Admin dashboard toggle UI
  - Instant effect (no redeploy required)
  - All changes audit logged

Fallback Behavior:
  - Every disabled capability has defined fallback
  - System never throws exceptions when feature disabled
  - Graceful degradation to maintain core functionality
```

## Rollback Mechanisms

```
Application rollback:
  - Vercel: Instant rollback to previous deploy
  - Workers: Redeploy previous image

Database rollback:
  - Migrations are versioned
  - Rollback scripts for each migration
  - Point-in-time recovery (Supabase)

Mobile rollback:
  - OTA updates via Expo
  - Version pinning: min_supported_version
  - Force update if critical
```
