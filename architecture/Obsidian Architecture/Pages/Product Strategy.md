# 🚀 Product & Integrations Strategy

> [!TIP] **Purpose**
> This page defines the "Future State" of CampoTech's ecosystem. These are links found in the footer that need to become real value-adds.

## 🔌 Integrations (Wishlist)

### 1. Payment Gateways (Argentina)
- [ ] **MercadoPago:**
    - *Idea:* Split payments (Client pays -> Technician gets 95% -> CampoTech gets 5%).
    - *Action:* Need to valid OAuth flows.
- [ ] **Transferencias 3.0 (QR):**
    - *Idea:* Technician shows QR code on phone after job is done.

### 2. ERP / Accounting
- [ ] **AFIP WS:**
    - *Status:* Partially implemented?
    - *Goal:* 1-click "Factura C".
- [ ] **Xero / Quickbooks:** (Low priority for local market, maybe replace with 'Tiendas Nube'?)

## 🛠️ Public API
**Goal:** Allow larger service companies (10+ techs) to feed data into their own dashboards.
- `GET /technicians/status`
- `POST /jobs/new`
