An attacker can write uploaded files to arbitrary locations on the filesystem by crafting a malicious filename.  ### Details  When `UPLOAD_DIR` is set and `UPLOAD_KEEP_FILENAME` is `True`, the library constructs the file path using `os.path.join(file_dir, fname)`. Due to the behavior of `os.path.join()`, if the filename begins with a `/`, all preceding path components are discarded:  ```py os.path.join(\"/upload/dir\", \"/etc/malicious\") == \"/etc/malicious\" ```                          This allows an attacker to bypass the intended upload directory and write files to arbitrary paths.                                                                                                                                                                                         #### Affected Configuration                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Projects are only affected if all of the following are true:                                                                                      - `UPLOAD_DIR` is set - `UPLOAD_KEEP_FILENAME` is set to True - The uploaded file exceeds `MAX_MEMORY_FILE_SIZE` (triggering a flush to disk)  The default configuration is not vulnerable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                #### Impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Arbitrary file write to attacker-controlled paths on the filesystem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        #### Mitigation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Upgrade to version 0.0.22, or avoid using `UPLOAD_KEEP_FILENAME=True` in project configurations."}]}, {"name": "pyyaml", "version": "6.0.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "redis", "version": "7.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "regex", "version": "2025.11.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "requests", "version": "2.32.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "requests-toolbelt", "version": "1.0.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "rich", "version": "14.3.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "ruff", "version": "0.14.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "sniffio", "version": "1.3.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "sortedcontainers", "version": "2.4.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "starlette", "version": "0.50.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tenacity", "version": "9.1.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tiktoken", "version": "0.12.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tomli", "version": "2.4.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tomli-w", "version": "1.2.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "tqdm", "version": "4.67.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "types-requests", "version": "2.32.4.20250913", "vulns": []}, {"name": "typing-extensions", "version": "4.15.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "typing-inspection", "version": "0.4.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "urllib3", "version": "2.5.0", "vulns": [{"id": "CVE-2025-66418", "fix_versions": ["2.6.0"], "aliases": ["GHSA-gm62-xv2j-4w53"], "description": "## Impact  urllib3 supports chained HTTP encoding algorithms for response content according to RFC 9110 (e.g., `Content-Encoding: gzip, zstd`).

When streaming a compressed response, urllib3 can perform decoding or decompression based on the HTTP `Content-Encoding` header (e.g., `gzip`, `deflate`, `br`, or `zstd`). The library must read compressed data from the network and decompress it until the requested chunk size is met. Any resulting decompressed data that exceeds the requested amount is held in an internal buffer for the next read operation.  The decompression logic could cause urllib3 to fully decode a small amount of highly compressed data in a single operation. This can result in excessive resource consumption (high CPU usage and massive memory allocation for the decompressed data; CWE-409) on the client side, even if the application only requested a small chunk of data.   ### Affected usages  Applications and libraries using urllib3 version 2.5.0 and earlier to stream large compressed responses or content from untrusted sources.  `stream()`, `read(amt=256)`, `read1(amt=256)`, `read_chunked(amt=256)`, `readinto(b)` are examples of `urllib3.HTTPResponse` method calls using the affected logic unless decoding is disabled explicitly.   ### Remediation  Upgrade to at least urllib3 v2.6.0 in which the library avoids decompressing data that exceeds the requested amount.

When using the streaming API, the library decompresses only the necessary bytes, enabling partial content consumption.  However, for HTTP redirect responses, the library would read the entire response body to drain the connection and decompress the content unnecessarily. This decompression occurred even before any read methods were called, and configured read limits did not restrict the amount of decompressed data. As a result, there was no safeguard against decompression bombs.
